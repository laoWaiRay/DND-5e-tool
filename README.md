## About
This is a personal project I made to help my friends organize our D&D games. The DM can use the tool to help them run games by providing helpful features like initiative tracking, health and status tracking, encounter building and fast lookup of game rules.

The app can be found here: https://roll-for-initiative-delta.vercel.app/
